# Hey there 👋

Hello there, my name is Szymon. I'm a young frontend dev from **Poland**.

In my free time I usually chill to some music.

### Projects 🧐

Most of my coding time is spent developing in closed source repos. Although you might find some of my older work below.. 

*Most of it is really old don't judge the code quality please 😶*
